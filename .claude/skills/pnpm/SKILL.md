# pnpm

Dependencies, locking and workspace layout. Read the reference matching your
task.

| Doing | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Editing a package.json — scripts, exports, deps | [Manifest discipline](references/manifest-discipline.md) |
| Supply chain, build allowlists, overrides, peers, .npmrc | [Supply chain & settings](references/supply-chain.md) |
| Workspace layout, catalogs, linking | [Workspace](references/workspace.md) |

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` is pnpm's settings file for **any** repo shape — a
single-package repo keeps it for the supply-chain half and omits only the
workspace-layout half.

**The rule that does not wait for a reference:** one package manager, one
lockfile, committed, and CI installs frozen.
